# Visual & Interactive Computing – Study & Project Repo

> This repository documents my self-directed preparation for graduate studies in  
> **Computer Graphics, Visual Computing, and Human–Computer Interaction.**  
> It includes structured notes on foundational mathematics / algorithms  
> and small hands-on coding projects related to graphics & visualization.


## 🎯 Goal
Strengthen core knowledge required for graduate-level coursework in:
- Linear Algebra
- Algorithms / Data Structures
- Computer Graphics / Rendering

This repository serves as a log of my learning process and practical exploration.

## 🔎 Motivation

Coming from a software engineering & UX background,  
I am strengthening my theoretical foundation in order to pursue  
**graduate research in Visual Computing / Graphics / HCI.**

This repo documents:
- What I have learned
- How I applied new knowledge
- Areas I plan to explore further

My focus is on **learning by doing** — combining theory + practice.
